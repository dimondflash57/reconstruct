## Add Your Own Data-Type

### Step 1
First of all, you need to create a `ModuleScript`[^1] and name it whatever type you want it to be (e.g, `Color3`[^2], `table`[^3]

### Step 2

[^1]: A type of `Script` that returns any value. In this case, `function`s ( see documentation [here](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ModuleScript) ) 
[^2]: A type that Roblox uses for coloring objects, UI, etc. ( see documentation [here](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/datatypes/Color3) )
